        <p>Key workforce transformations by 2030:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>60% of employers expect digital access to reshape their businesses</li>
          <li>86% identify AI and information processing as transformative</li>
          <li>39% of current worker skill sets will become outdated</li>
          <li>85% of employers plan to prioritize workforce upskilling</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The skills landscape is undergoing a significant shift. The most in-demand skills for the future combine technical and human capabilities: AI and big data top the list, followed by cybersecurity and technological literacy, while analytical thinking remains the most sought-after core skill.

            The job market is experiencing both growth and decline in different sectors. Technology-related roles, including Big Data Specialists and AI specialists, show the fastest growth in percentage terms. Meanwhile, traditional clerical and secretarial positions face the steepest decline, particularly affecting roles like bank tellers and data entry clerks.

            Looking ahead, employers are actively preparing for this transition. About half plan to reorient their business in response to AI, with two-thirds planning to hire AI-specific talent. However, 40% anticipate reducing their workforce where AI can automate tasks, highlighting the dual nature of technological advancement in the workplace.
